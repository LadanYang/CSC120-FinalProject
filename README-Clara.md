# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

 Build some bacis codes and then furnish.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

 I learn how to implement GUI and resize images.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

  Currently, artifacts are stored under appliance (hashtable), which means when the player leaves the room or the appliance, they can no longer grab/drop/examine that item. This is inconvenient for players to do further actions. I wish we have set this up different so that players can access any item any time. 

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

  I want to figure out how to close the window when players click the top.
  I also found that players want to have some place where they can store the informations.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 
"You can use hashtable to connect the items"--Jordan, this is really helpful because we were orignally stuck that we couldn't interact with the items because we can't convert string into appliance/artifact objects

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
Ask more people to play the game!

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

We worked together very well, everyone devotes many time, take turn furnishing the projects, actively take up the part that's missing, which allow me to have some rest and also get different opinions from groupmates. So this is a wonderful experience for me.
