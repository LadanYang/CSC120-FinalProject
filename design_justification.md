Having a murder mystery plot lent the game to being freeform because we left a lot up to the player. Each clue was open to interpretation and that's what presented the challenge. Also, as a detective the player should have access to any room they choose to go to. In some adventure games, it makes sense that some rooms aren't available but here the detective is given free rein to explore this space as they so choose. 

That said, have the gameplay be so open-ended has made it feel less interactive than some other games. In order to build more momentum and have the player feel as though they were moving in the right direction, another possible design is having the game feel more directed by not only having more descriptive clues related to each item but detailing more of a interpretation along with it. Another idea is that if players are looking at too many red herring clues (which we could make an array list for) we could have a hint prompt.
